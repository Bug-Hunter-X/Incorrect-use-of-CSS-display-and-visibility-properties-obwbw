This repository demonstrates a common mistake in HTML/CSS related to hiding elements. The bug showcases the difference between using `display: none;` and `visibility: hidden;` when attempting to hide an element.  `visibility: hidden;` leaves the space the element occupied while `display: none;` removes the element completely from the layout. The solution illustrates the correct use of `display: none;` to hide elements without preserving their layout space.
